# Find one potential topic of the realistic problems.
In reality, people who have been sitting at their desks for a long time, may be students or people who rely on computers for work, have physical health problems.
The physical health problem here only refers to physical health problems caused by reasons such as facing the screen for a long time or writing with your head down.
Such health problems are often manifested as joint swelling and pain, muscle soreness, etc.They seem to be short-term symptoms, but there is a risk of developing chronic diseases in the long run.
However, most people may not actively solve such problems, but rely on methods such as sleep or the symptoms will automatically disappear after a few days. But the fact is that although the above methods sometimes work, but quickly The next symptoms will appear, which will form an infinite loop, which not only cannot cure the pain, but also causes more damage to the body due to frequent relapses.
Therefore, we are committed to reminding and popularizing science to the public about the prevention and improvement of desk pain. On the one hand, we can correct posture to avoid related physical pain problems, and on the other hand, we can give some simple methods, like office exercise,  to cure the pain proactively. 
# Find the target user.
According to our predictions, potential users may be students or staff who need to face the screen.
The latter detailed analysis may include computer practitioners in the same industry as ours, or designers engaged in computer-aided design software, or creators of multimedia materials, such as text and video.
# Discuss what their common characteristics are.
The above types of potential users have the only feature in common, which is simply people who are suffering from desk pain.
Through analysis, we speculate that, on the one hand, it is caused by the work scene, on the other hand, it may be caused by the length of working time. These two factors are indispensable. After the above two backgrounds are met at the same time, if your posture Incorrect, it is very prone to desk pain.
# Discuss where and when they encounter the problem.
Potential scenarios are, for example, employees who have worked for a day, students who have been studying for a day, the whole team members are trying to drive out a project, or candidates who have just taken the exam for a whole day.

Project Proposal
Title:  Make painful painful 


Occupational diseases of engineers 

Headline/Tweet: The Start point of understanding your body / posture 

Series Problem:
-    Raise awareness of long-term health implications of incorrect posture.
-    Propose possible solutions to improve these issues.
-    Provide a certain sense of solidarity and be able to see the stats of other users’(spots of discomfort)
-    Mainly target at people with desk jobs, but could even extend this to students. 



Play integration:

What are you going to make? :

What features will your project have? What is the scope of project? 
Our project will help people identity certain occupational diseases all over their bodies using human body diagram. We well provide detailed explanations and potential relief solutions to all the diseases listed. 
This project would mainly focus on physical pain caused by long time working in front of computers these days and we will narrow down features to disease identity and potential solution offering. 

What are the technical challenges? Are you using an external API/database? 

Technical challenges:
Interaction: 
1. The performance of the interaction on the "body"
2. The Graphical quality of the body
3. API @Qi
