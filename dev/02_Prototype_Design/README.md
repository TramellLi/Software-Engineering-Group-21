# Overall Architecture of the  Application Information
Macroscopically, the function of our SPA is to prompt the symptoms, causes, and related treatment methods of pain in the specified body part based on the user's click.
In order to allow users not only to obtain information, but also to communicate with the page and other users behind the page, we have added a vote function.If the user has the same painful part, they can click the vote button.
The result of the vote will be displayed in the left half of the whole page in the form of a horizontal bar graph. The reason why we do not choose numbers, but a bar graph to display the vote results, is mainly due to the following reasons:
First of all, the bar graph is more intuitive than the numbers. It can directly see the overall voting interaction and clearly see the number of votes in each part (the length of the bar graph is used as a dynamic display). Secondly, Through the bar graph, you can intuitively observe the relationship between the number of pain in different body parts. The third point, our users can according to their own situation whether it is common pain.
In addition, we have also defined some potential functions waiting to be developed, and these are optional.
Such as page settings, login function, feedback link, open source interaction, etc.
All the above descriptions are written in the "SPA info net.png" file under the same path, and are briefly presented in the form of a network relationship diagram.
