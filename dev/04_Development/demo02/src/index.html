It is important to maintain a good posture and meet human mechanics requirements when standing, sitting, or engaging in any activity. Patients should learn the correct way to stand and sit to prevent neck sprains. Patients sleeping sideways apply pillows to support the head and neck so that the head and neck remain in the middle (neither toward the bed nor towards the ceiling). Patients sleeping on their backs should use pillows to support their heads and necks, but do not raise them. Patients should avoid sleeping in a receding position.
