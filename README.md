**Introduction** 

We really wanted to come up with a product that is educational and relatable to everyone in this day and age, just so that our potential users would enjoy the learning and problem solving process as they navigate through our website. 

With the ever-increasing number of hours stated on our Weekly Screentime Report over the past year since the pandemic first hit, so much has changed in terms of the way we work and interact with each other, 11 million people have suffered aches and pain as a result to bad posturing and an extremely sedentary livestyle. Even prior to the pandemic, **developers** and **office workers** (also CS students) are known to develop chronic pain and other more severe permanent damange on their body due to prolonged static sitting.

We figured that we could come up with an easy and comprehensive guide in the form of a interactive website that aims to increase our user's awareness on the importance of good posturing and maybe even develop an incentive for users to engage in frequent exercises in the long-run.

Our website is not your regular fitness&training website, nor is it another webisite loaded with heavy medical terms intended only for medics or physiotherapists to visit. It is going to be a simple and comprehensive guide involving the silhouette of a human body with certain parts, when being clicked will provide users with the **name**, **description of pain**, **causes of pain**, and a **list of possible solutions**.
