# Project Proposal

###### Title: Posture Right
###### Headline/Tweet: The Starting point of understanding your body and posture, and possibly smash that pain!
---

#####  Problem to Solve:
-	Raise awareness of long-term health implications of incorrect posture.
-	Shed light on possible causes and possible solutions to improve discomfort due to bad posture.
-	Mainly target at people with desk jobs, but could even extend this to students. 

##### Game integration:
-	End-user interaction: multiple spots of the body can be clicked on -> name of discomfort and information of related body part will appear -> information includes 1) possible muscle groups involved in the discomfort 2) links to possible solutions to solving these problems.
-	Collection of statistics (voting): a graph gives an overall view of the number of people who share the same problem (who have clicked on and have said that they have the same problem).

##### What are you going to make?
A simple website that has a silhouette of a human body with certain parts of it activated allowing end-user to click on and explore onwards.

What features will your project have? What is the scope of project? 
Our project entails a minimalistic silhouette or a 3D model of a human body that allows our end-users to click on certain parts of the body, with the aim to educate our end-users on the discomfort or underlining health implications that they may experience with the prevalence of an ever more Sedentary lifestyle during the pandemic. 

We plan to achieve this through a small roadmap - when body parts are clicked on this information will appear, and each with a link that leads to the following stage until the user gets to IV :  
I.	 Name(s) of muscle (groups)
II.	 Name(s)/type(s) of discomfort
III.	Description of symptoms
IV.	External links to possible solutions of these discomfort.  
V.	
The second aim and feature of our webpage is to collect and present user data in the form of a bar chart, allowing our end-users to have a general idea of the severity AND the commonality of pain occurrence in these body parts. 

What are the technical challenges? Are you using an external API/database? 
##### Technical challenges:
###### 1) How to achieve interaction:
-	The human body drawing/model: find code on git-hub, how to stick it to our main page
-	Finding the relevant API (Qi)
-	The accuracy of medical advice (always put disclaimer in a visible placer to always consult a medical professional before following any sort of advice )
###### 2) Data collection: 
-	How to display the collected data: display type
-	We are hoping to achieve communication amongst users.
-	From where do we collect our initial data? (questionnaires? Or fabricate data for our model)
