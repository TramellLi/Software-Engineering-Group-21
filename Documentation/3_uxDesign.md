# UX Design


#### Ideation-User personas 

We have decided very early on that our product was going to be a health-related app as it was inspired by one of our team member’s visits to the orthopedic doctor to checkout his persistent back pain. Knowing that there are already other educational apps for professionals working in the field to use, we wanted mainly to target users that have no medical background to use our product, like your team member – people who work in offices, students who do not necessarily have prior experience or interest in sports & exercise medicine, this would mean that our website needs to be simple to navigate and the content& explanation of body parts would need to be succinct and accurate.  

Having had an idea of our project that all group members really liked from early an early stage allowed us to start discovering possible problems that  we  will want to solve with our deliverables, and we decided to use questionnaires to help identify and confirm our target user and problembs that our product could help to solve.

Our questionnaire aims get us an idea of the age group of potential user and the numbers of hours they spend everyday in front of a desk, and whether or not they have sought for medical help as well as their awareness and interest of these health related app. 

We have collected answers from people in both their 20s and 30s, and all of these users  spend at least 3 hours in front of the computer everyday.
88.9% out of these people are currently experiencing discomfort but only 37.5% look for self-help video as an attempt to ease discomfort and 12.5% among which has had experience with the help of sports medicine.

- most people work on a desk experience discomfort
- people are in pain but are not aware that they could look up self-help videos/tutorials onlin. 
- lack of exposure to self-help option – misconception sports != medicine
- lack of exposure-> caused lack of interest in sports medicine
 “ I do not have time to always book myself in for consultation”
 “ my doctor has told me that I should move around more, or stretch more, but without telling me specifically what to do, most of the time I do not even know where to start looking”



**User/Stakeholder:**

Students 
Office workers 
Anyone who feels uncomfortable when using computer for a long time 
Sports medical professional (he takes a guiding role in helping us to decide what information to include or omit, ensures that the website content stays as accurate as possible)

**Define-issues:** 
-	How do we increase the general people's(the non-medics) awareness on the importance of posture.
-	How do we trigger the their interest in wanting to finding out more about self-help and sports medicine to ease discomfort resulted from sitting down for too long. 
-	How to we make it easier for the them to start understanding the basic subject knowledges. 
	
#### Solve: issues:
-	Our webpage need to be straight forward, simple colors and navigation 
-	Design and drawing need to be cute and simple, diagram of human body should be minimalistic and not overly complicated to put people off from wanting to continue to explore. differ from apps that target at educational apps target at l professionals
-	With simple and cute human body diagram, the information that we decide to display need to be succinct but also as accurate as possible (need someone professional from the field to consult and decide what information to put/omit) to give our target users a general idea of body parts and muscle groups related to the discomfort.

**Using design heuristics**
 
**Consistency and standards**: We make sure that our graphic elements and terminology are maintained across the whole website, so that our users could easily associate certain shapes of the window/textbox  with specific function/ information that we want to display on our site. 

**Recognition rather than recall**: we are eliminating cognitive load by maintaining relevant information within the display, while our users explore the content of the app. We aim to make our product a light-hearted education app and to ensure that users can simply employ recognition instead of relacing information when exploring the app, we are using little arrows to guide our users through. 
 
**Aesthetic and minimalist design**: Keeping clutter to a minimum. All unnecessary information competes for the user’s limited attentional resources is kept at minimal, which inhibit user’s memory retrieval of relevant information – this is why we are only using a minimalist human-shaped model rather than a detailed version of human anatomy diagram. Similarly, the general tone and colour is also used sparingly, so that our user’s attention can be called to learn a bit more about postural related discomfort.
