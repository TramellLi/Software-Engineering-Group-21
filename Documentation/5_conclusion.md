# Conclusion

### Evaluation our project in the light of ‘9 Principles of ethical innovation’:

1. Design with the user:
  One of the potential users that we interviewed is on our course, and we were engaging in frequent voice calls when the group was deciding on what information to display on our app. Apart from expectations of information displayed to be straight forward, he/ she also wanted to feel a sense of being included in a group of people who is getting discomfort and chronic pains, and to make him feel less alone, we ended up deciding on making a chart to collect and display user statistics. 


2. Understanding existing ecosystem:

  We did find a few existing human anatomy / health-related apps ranging from aimed at educating medical professionals to sports apps that just meant to give you a list of exercises to do, we did notice that there is no app that specifically focuses on postures or that is built on the premise of ‘chronic pain caused by sitting down for too long’.  

  Our app is not aiming to be a healthcare app and is not meant to be used to give professional medical advice, so we did not consider the option of reaching out to the Care Quality Commission to make sure that our app would be up to NHS standards. It only meant to provide a simple and general idea of how body response to static sitting and what people area of research people could consider or look into in their further pursuit of fixing their discomfort.

3. Design for scale: 

  We did not really consider this aspect of the project during our design. It started off with a casual conversation with our course mate who was really getting back pain three months in to this course. Because it just targets at people who has a little bit of chronic pain working in front of desk, we were only getting our content checked and supervised by this course mate’s physiotherapies.  The lack of the consideration of our scale would probably limit how the app will evolve unless we decide to make a few changes such as getting the approved by the Care Quality Commission and Organisation for the Review of Care and Health Apps.  

4. Build for sustainability: Not applicable

5. Be data driven:

  The idea of our app was mainly inspired by one team member’s discomfort and visit to the orthopedic, but it was the constant calls with another course mate that mainly shaped the design of our product, and he was being treated as a potential user. 

6. Use open standards/ data/sources/ innovation: 

  We publish our development process on github and it is open for everyone to see.

7. Reuse and improve:

  We publish our development process on github and it is open for everyone to see, and were there to be medical professionals who want to use our framework and add to / change certain content they will be able to.

8. Do no harm

  Users need to understand that our app only wants to be a lighthearted beginners guide to some form of understanding  of very simplified logic as to  how our bodies work, and to raise awareness of the harm caused by static sitting and how to start looking into dealing with their discomfort and to remind them of this, we have wrote a long and detailed reminder on the bottom of our website. 

9. Be collaborative: 

 Be collaborative here means to bring many voices on board, we fell short on this aspect as the only people we brought in were one physiotherapist, who was there to supervise the logic and the content to put on, and users that we’d interviewed were only student or people who have been working at a desk job for a while.   In retrospective, we could have involved people from a wider age group, rather than just people in their 20, 30s,such as older people,  as they might give different perspective in the layouts the app such as more intuitive design. We could also have brought in people who work on a desk but designers, they might have given us more input in terms of the aesthetics of the app.
