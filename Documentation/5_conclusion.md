# Conclusion

### Reflection over project workflow:
 
**	Work practices of my group **
The cooperation between front end and back end had been challenging for this project. Despite having met up on a regular basis and have had well defined scope from the beginning, we have taken a ridgid approach in delegating work for this project. We clarified and delegated roles to all group members right at the start and thinking that Front-end will only need to learn about front-end and back-end person would only need to learn about back-end content and we fell short on time as our front-end developers had to go off and learn some more backend-related content and vice versa to make everything work. Not being able to see the overlappig aspect of front and back-end resulted a lot of struggle when working with data transfer and the process of applying API in the whole of this project. To solve this we used several small Sprints over the past two week to cut down the API coding and divided the process into smaller steps and tried every step by trail and error. 

**	Success level of our project **
Overall, our project has achieved the basic functions that we want to implement. Such as clickable tags that prompts a little window with information displayed, gathering votes from users and displaying it on our barchart. However, visually, we have eventually strayed off from the original plan during the building process, we have had to sacrifice some of the functions and objects, such as having a more animated version of the human body making the app more interactive and aesthetically pleasing. 

**	The impact of coronavirus on our project**
Working remotely from home has been the new norm since the pandemic, increasing the chance of discomfort resulted frmo static sitting, the type of occupational disease that people normally get from working in an office. In this context, it makes our app very relatable and relevant for anyone who works from home.

Having to work remotely from home has affected our ability to coorperate to a certain extend. However, due to the different range of personalities in our team, some of our members do believe that meeting up in person during the planning phase could have been valuable team-building experience to speed up the process of getting used to work with each other. However we did overcome this unpleasant aspect of our project by agreeing on turning our camera on for our meetings once in a while.  

** Social & ethical implication （按网页上的就好）**
•	Future work 
1.	Make the webpage more interactive with more playful functions. 
2.	Design some small rewards for users to encourage them to do the voting and commenting. 
3.	Add user authentication to personalize the webpage for every user. 
4.	Beautify our webpage with a more vivid human body. 




### Reflection of our project in the light of ‘9 Principles of ethical innovation’:

1. Design with the user:
  One of the potential users that we interviewed is on our course, and we were engaging in frequent voice calls when the group was deciding on what information to display on our app. Apart from expectations of information displayed to be straight forward, he/ she also wanted to feel a sense of being included in a group of people who is getting discomfort and chronic pains, and to make him feel less alone, we ended up deciding on making a chart to collect and display user statistics. 


2. Understanding existing ecosystem:

  We did find a few existing human anatomy / health-related apps ranging from aimed at educating medical professionals to sports apps that just meant to give you a list of exercises to do, we did notice that there is no app that specifically focuses on postures or that is built on the premise of ‘chronic pain caused by sitting down for too long’.  

  Our app is not aiming to be a healthcare app and is not meant to be used to give professional medical advice, so we did not consider the option of reaching out to the Care Quality Commission to make sure that our app would be up to NHS standards. It only meant to provide a simple and general idea of how body response to static sitting and what people area of research people could consider or look into in their further pursuit of fixing their discomfort.

3. Design for scale: 

  We did not really consider this aspect of the project during our design. It started off with a casual conversation with our course mate who was really getting back pain three months in to this course. Because it just targets at people who has a little bit of chronic pain working in front of desk, we were only getting our content checked and supervised by this course mate’s physiotherapies.  The lack of the consideration of our scale would probably limit how the app will evolve unless we decide to make a few changes such as getting the approved by the Care Quality Commission and Organisation for the Review of Care and Health Apps.  

4. Build for sustainability: Not applicable

5. Be data driven:

  The idea of our app was mainly inspired by one team member’s discomfort and visit to the orthopedic, but it was the constant calls with another course mate that mainly shaped the design of our product, and he was being treated as a potential user. 

6. Use open standards/ data/sources/ innovation: 

  We publish our development process on github and it is open for everyone to see.

7. Reuse and improve:

  We publish our development process on github and it is open for everyone to see, and were there to be medical professionals who want to use our framework and add to / change certain content they will be able to.

8. Do no harm

  Users need to understand that our app only wants to be a lighthearted beginners guide to some form of understanding  of very simplified logic as to  how our bodies work, and to raise awareness of the harm caused by static sitting and how to start looking into dealing with their discomfort and to remind them of this, we have wrote a long and detailed reminder on the bottom of our website. 

9. Be collaborative: 

 Be collaborative here means to bring many voices on board, we fell short on this aspect as the only people we brought in were one physiotherapist, who was there to supervise the logic and the content to put on, and users that we’d interviewed were only student or people who have been working at a desk job for a while.   In retrospective, we could have involved people from a wider age group, rather than just people in their 20, 30s,such as older people,  as they might give different perspective in the layouts the app such as more intuitive design. We could also have brought in people who work on a desk but designers, they might have given us more input in terms of the aesthetics of the app.
