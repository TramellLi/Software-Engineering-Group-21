# Background and Motivation:


Injuries resulting from sitting for a long period of time are a serious occupational health and safety problem. Even though sitting down requires less muscular effort, it does not exempt people from the injury risks usually associated with more physically demanding tasks. For example, clerks, developers who work in a sitting position all tend to suffer from backpain, muscle tenderness and aches[[2]]. This is because once you are used to not moving much, ‘muscle breakdown can start in as little as 24 hours, and aches and pains will start to creep in.’ Dr.Richard Yoon [[1]], chief of orthopaedics at Jersey City Medical centre in New Jersey stated. 

In fact, reports of varicose veins, stiff neck, and other postural related Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are more common among seated employees than among those doing heavier tasks [[4]]. Furthermore, sedentary time has also been found associated with numerous metabolic syndrome(heart diseases, diabetes and poor mental health. )  [[2]] One of the largest pieces of research to date on the subject- involving around 800,000 people found that compared with those who sat the least, people who sat the longest had a: 

>-     112% increase in risk of diabetes
>-     147% increase in cardiovascular events
>-     90% increase in death caused by cardiovascular events
>-     49% increase in death from any cause  

Movement and exercise are an important Musculoskeletal disorder prevention measure, but people tend to overlook these health implications until symptoms start to emerge.  It is true  that young people tend to be more resilient than older adults in the face of physical ramifications from bad postures and inactivity, but there is a lack of awareness and understanding of how inactivity could diminish one’s physical capacity to engage in intense outdoor activities for people of all ages and this is reflected in the noticeable rise in sports injuries among school kids as schools have reopened again after months of lockdown[[3]]. 

Health and exercise apps are not something entirely new, in fact there are a few prominent and award-winning physical therapy apps such as PocketAnatomy and Muscle & Bone Anatomy 3D on the market up available for download. These apps provide highly accurate interactive overview of the anatomy of the human body and with very detailed description and understanding of the skeletal, lymphatic, circulatory and nervous system. These apps mainly target at people working in the field or who are studying to enter the field as well as patients working to recover. Similarly, there are countless exercising apps and programs available online for fitness lovers and for those with fitness goals in mind. Target audience of these two types of apps share a similarity in that they both have a set of goals that they want to achieve through these apps, in other words, they already have some degree of appreciation and awareness over the importance of moving and exercising.

The intention behind our app is therefore to alleviate risks of injury and other long term health hazards caused by static load, through raising the awareness of general public in the prominence of having a good posture and of exercising. As mentioned earlier that most people do not look into remedies until discomfort start to kick in, with this in mind, we look to trigger our potential user’s interest in human body and sports anatomy by integrating multiple choice questions when users click on various parts of our human body diagram. It is important to stress again that suggestions and information on our website are meant for the general public to play with and are not offered as a substitute for the qualified medical advice or treatment. It is meant to be a fun little website that hopes to promote healthy living, and to shed some light on a better understanding of preventive measures against or even basic exercises to combat discomfort caused by a sedentary lifestyle.
