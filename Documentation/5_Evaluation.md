# Evaluation
#### Details of design evaluation
Our project evaluation majorly focuses on two parts: unit testing and user acceptance testing. 
For unit testing, we first made test plan and then used tools like Jasmine and Karma to help us with actual testing script coding.

As for user acceptance testing, we have employed both quantitative and qualitative evaluation techniques. Different evaluation techniques have different purposes: We are using self-completion questionnaires to get a general number count of how idea of how well the design and function of our app is for users. And we will also be engaging in short conversation with the two users that we talked to during the UX design phase, to get a more detailed response of how they feel about and view our product. 


#### -Quantitative - Self-completion questionnaires
This form of evaluation is less prone to biased issues and will only be number of votes, and can be done without external help and is very quick to finish collecting data.

#### -Qualitative – Interview 
This is used more to get more detailed views and feelings towards our app , and is a great way to explore process in terms of future development for our app.

However, there are some limitations inherent in the technique we used. The questions in the questionnair might be leading （有引导性的）.

#### Timeline of evaluation 

#### Unit/Functional testing
To prevent software defects, our group uses Jasmine as well as KARMA to test our codes.  
Functional testing plan: 
1.Test body part mouse moveover event 
2.Test if comments are correctly displayed
3.Test user comment function 
Used KARMA to run the testing.  
 
Other webpage functional checking:  
(1) Whether the link/url is valid; 
(2) Whether the webpage can cater to different browser types or versions and browser on phone;
(3) Webpage load speed check. 


#### User acceptance testing
For user acceptance testing, our group choose to use quantitative method and focus on several criteria when designing and analyzing the questionnaire for our users, including the following:

•	Web convenience level 
•	Measure touchpoint events  
•	User engagement level 
        -Click rate / vote rate            
        -Site visitor surfing time  
•	Ease of understanding  
•	Content quality 

After we collected the user feedback for the first time and analyzed on them, we found that the vote rate is relatively low. In order to solve that, we made our vote buttons on the left hand side larger with black boarder. In the future, to further improve the vote and user interaction rate,  we would design some small rewards to encourage them to vote. 
Besides that, the convenience level and ease of understanding are both very high as our webpage is very straightforward. However, due to time limitation, our contents now are just of fair quality as indicated by user feedback which is another area that needs further development in the future.
