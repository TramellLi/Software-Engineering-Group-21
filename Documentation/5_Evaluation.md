# Evaluation
We have employed both quantitative and qualitative evaluation techniques for our UAT. Different evaluation techniques have different purposes: We are using self-completion questionnaires to get a general idea of how comfortable and how well our app is, but we will also be engaging in short conversation with the two users that we talked to during the UX design phase, to get a more detailed response of how they feel about our product.
