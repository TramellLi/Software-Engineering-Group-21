# Evaluation
#### Details of design evaluation
Our project evaluation majorly focuses on two parts: unit testing and user acceptance testing. 
For unit testing, we first made test plan and then used tools like Jasmine and Karma to help us with actual testing script coding.

As for user acceptance testing, we have employed both quantitative and qualitative evaluation techniques. Different evaluation techniques have different purposes: We are using self-completion questionnaires to get a general number count of how idea of how well the design and function of our app is for users. And we will also be engaging in short conversation with the two users that we talked to during the UX design phase, to get a more detailed response of how they feel about and view our product. 


#### Quantitative - Self-completion questionnaires
This form of evaluation is less prone to biased issues and will only be number of votes, and can be done without external help and is very quick to finish collecting data.

#### Qualitative â€“ Interview 
This is used more to get more detailed views and feelings towards our app , and is a great way to explore process in terms of future development for our app.
