# Sprints & Project Management


We have chosen Waterfall model to develop our app, it follows a sequential process flow in which team completes the project management steps in stages, pretty much in the same way water cascades from top fownwards in a waterfall. It is strickly linear in nature and relies on team members to follow a sequence of steps and only move forward when the current stage is done. This would be the most suitable model for us given we have a small and its distinct stages of development will help us to better define and tack the progress from the start.

Here are the 3 key principles of the WaterFall model:
| Principle 1: Sequential project structure    | Principle 2: Low degree of customer involvement | Principle 3: Strong project documentation|
| :-----------                                 | :-----------                                     | :-----------                              |
|- Project activities are broken down into strictly sequential phases      | - Low client participation      | - Advocates the so-called “big bang approach” it requires lots of details upfront |
|- Once a phase is complete, it is be difficult to make changes to it  | - After requirement phase customer involvement is limited        |   -  Include the deliverables criteria, the specific skills needed to complete the project, the project’s timeline, and how the team plans to tackle the project from beginning to end |



According to this model, project would not be able to proceed until the first step is complete, so when problems arise, it will be brought to attention right away, forcing team members to react right away and to refine tasks of each stage before proceeding. This is especially apparent with the first stage of our project where we took our time in identifying deliverables and requirments of our product, however later on in the implementation stage we also ran into technical issues causing us to go back and review our design and to slightly push our schedule back to allow more time to find new approaches.  (Details issues encountered will be found in [ [System Implementation] ] )

**1. Idea pitching and define requirement (11/02 – 09/03)**
We started off with brainstorming and idea pitching and have steered towards creating an a health-related Single-age application. Over the course of the following weeks, we have decided to shrink the scope of our product down to a postural-related occupational diseases/discomfort body map for office workers. With the rough idea in mind, group members were set off to do some research on currently available health-related apps for inspirations, helping us to finally decide on decide what sections to include in our single webpage application.

**2. Product design (28/02 – 15/03)**
After research we have agreed to divide our website into four big sections: 
1) Headers sections:
	Product Name
	Logo
2) Barchart section:
	Bar chart that demonstrates voting statistics
3) Mainbody section:
	Human body diagram
	Clickable areas on human body
	Popup window when areas are clicked
4) Footer section:
	Disclaimer text
	
Team members have decided to use MEAN stack to realize our project and have assigned roles to team members:

- Front-End: Chongyan Qi , Wayne GuangZhe Wen
- Back-End: Jian Chen
- Verification & UT: Tramell Li
- Documentation: Yanjun Liu

**3. Implementation(10/03-30/04):**

Parallel working and code sharing with our Frond-end and Back-end coders.
Building docker file, and different versions of code has been uploaded to our dev branch
A few implementations have deviated from the original design of our project because we overestimated our ability to build the project, and in trying to solve issues such as linking up the Front-end and Back-end, we have pushed our schedules for UAT testing back by 7 days, from 04/21 to 30/04.

Waterfall model insists that teams wait until implementation finishes before starting the UAT-testing, which would lead to have a small window of time left to do a large revision of our product.


**4. System Verification(30/04-07/04):**

UT-testing
UAT -testing
